## Prerequisites

-  Adequate prior knowledge of GraphQL end-points and Queries.

## Directions

1. Select `post`from either the drop down menu or the Quick Method Selection section.
2. Set the GraphQL `end-point` in the URL bar.
3. Select the `GraphQL queries` item the Quick Body Type Selection section.
4. Input a query payload inside the Request Panel.
