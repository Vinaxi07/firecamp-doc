import Zoom from 'react-medium-image-zoom';

## Prerequisites

- The request should be sent successfully

## Directions
In the response panel, you can review the following important information regarding your API. 

1. The `Body` tab in the Response Panel displays the results returned by the server in response to your request. In our case, it will return the Body payload that we sent through the `POST` API.
2. The `Headers` tab beside it shows the details about the response, like `content-type`, `cache-control`, `server name`, `date/time` of the response, etc.
3. Additionally, you can check for the cookies in the `Cookies` tab.
4. Another important tab is the `Timeline` tab that describes the timely information of the whole request lifecycle, from request originator to response completion. It is very useful to debug the request at a certain stage of the execution like SSL handshake, PROXY connected, etc.
