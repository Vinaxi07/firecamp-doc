## Prerequisites

- Request should be sent successfully

## Directions

1. Once you're done sending a request successfully, observe the results in the Response Panel.
2. The `Body` tab in the Response Panel displays the results returned by the server in response to your request.
3. The Headers tab beside it shows the details about the response, like `content-type`, `cache-control`, `server name`, `date/time` of the response, etc.
4. Additionally, you can check for the cookies in the `Cookies` tab.
5. Another important tab is the `Timeline` tab that describes the data and gives additional information about the request and the response.
