import Zoom from 'react-medium-image-zoom';

### Prerequisites

In order to follow along with this Action, it is advised to go through the previous Actions and relevant Impressions. Make sure you have:
- configured an API end-point
- selected a method type for your request
- selected a body type


### Directions

1. Based on the configuration of your request, you can *use the ready-made code snippet with the help of the code-generator*.
2. Navigate to the `Code` button in the top right corner of the Request Panel to get a list of pre-populated code-snippets.

        src="../assets/actions/generating-code-snippet-1.png"
        width="100%"
    />
</Zoom>

3. Switch to a `programming language` of your choice to retrieve its language friendly code snippet.
4. Select a suitable version of the snippet from the options available. For instance, you can select one out of `Native`, `Unirest`, and `Request`.
5. Copy the generated code snippet and embed it into your app for reusability.
