### Prerequisites

Protocol buffer is a payload that can be sent or recieved by the client and server using serializing/deserializing of your data. A protobuf schema can be used to describe the structure of the API request or a query.

In order to follow along with this Action, it is advised to go through the previous Actions and relevant Impressions. Make sure you have:

- Set an API end-point 
- Selected a method from the drop down or quick method type selection

### Directions

1. Select `Protocol Buffer` from the `Quick Body Type Selector`. 
2. Navigate to the `.Protocol Schema` tab in the `Response Panel` and write your Protobuf schema that describes the structure of your API request. 
3. Move back to the `Body` tab to write the API request. Encode the request using a message type from the `Encode Message Type` menu at the bottom. This will encode the request body.
4. To decode the response, use the same procedure by selecting a message type from the `Decode Message Type` menu. 
5. This method i used to remove the repeating keys from the JSON body and will only send values in a buffered stream from client to server and vice versa. This leads to an improved request/response time.
