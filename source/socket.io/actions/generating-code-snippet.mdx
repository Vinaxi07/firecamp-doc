## Prerequisites

In order to follow along with this Action, it is advised to go through the previous Actions and relevant Impressions. Make sure you have:
- configured an SocketIO end-point
- configured Emitters and Listeners


## Directions

1. Based on the configuration of your request, you can *use the ready-made code snippet with the help of the code-generator*.
2. Navigate to the `Code` button under the `URL` bar to get a list of pre-populated code-snippets.

<Zoom>
    <img
        alt="Code Snippets"
        src="../assets/actions/generating-code-snippet-1.png"
        width="100%"
    />
</Zoom>

3. Switch to a `programming language` of your choice to retrieve its language friendly code snippet.
4. Select a suitable version of the snippet from the options available.
5. Copy the generated code snippet and embed it into your app for reusability.

<Zoom>
    <img
        alt="Code Snippets"
        src="../assets/actions/generating-code-snippet-2.png"
        width="100%"
    />
</Zoom>

Awesome. You've saved a significate time.
