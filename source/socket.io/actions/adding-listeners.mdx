import Zoom from 'react-medium-image-zoom';

## Prerequisites

- A configured and connected Socket.io endpoint.

## Directions

1. Navigate to the `Listeners` panel to add a new event listener for your Socket.io connection. 
2. Go to the `+` field with the `Add event listener` placeholder and add your listener name. In our example, write `new message` , `user joined` 
3. Click on the `Add` button.
4. You can see your `Active` and `All` listeners in the tabs below the `Add listener` field.

Great! Next up, let's set up an Event Emitter shall we?
