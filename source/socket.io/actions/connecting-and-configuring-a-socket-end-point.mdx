1. To test your Socket.io connection, connect to the socket end-point in Firecamp.  
2. To achieve this connection, enter the `end-point` in the `URL` bar at the top of the window. For this example, write this URL `https://socketio-chat-h9jt.herokuapp.com/`in the URL section.
3. Configure the end-point by clicking on the `Config` icon on the left of the `Connect` button.
4. Enter the `Path` and set the `Query` and `Header` keys to configure the end-point.
