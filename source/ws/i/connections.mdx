## Overview
**Connections** tab offers a facility to create and manage multiple WS connections. Here each connection represents a **virtual client connection.** It helps to monitor/debug the connection messages in a single request-tab rather than switching between multiple request-tabs.

For the each connection you can set headers and query-params individually and easily can swtich between connection A to B and C.

## How to create a new connection?
To create a new WS connection just click on the `New Connection` button and type connection name (ex. `Alice`) and hit enter to create it. That simple.

1. Click on the `New Connection` button
2. Type connection name (ex `Alice`)
3. Hit Enter

## Connection Elements

Each connection has basically two elements. **Headers** and **Query Params**. You can switch the connection from it's drop-down to change its headers or query-params.

**1. Headers:**
In this table, you can specify the header's key in the `key` column and value in a `value` column. for example `Authorization: JTW MyLongJWTSalt`

**2. Query Params**: You can write query-parameter name with value in a given table with respect to the `Key` and `Value` column. for example `name: Alice`
