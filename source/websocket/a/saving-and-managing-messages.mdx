Testing and debugging WebSockets takes time and repetitive effort when covering a lot of cases in a distributed team environment. With Firecamp, your team members can save messages inside the WebSocket app for a faster, more convenient debugging experience.

## Prerequisites
- Establishing your First WebSocket connection
- Communicating with the server through messages

We will be using the sample endpoint `ws://echo.websocket.org` to establish the WebSocket connection.

## Directions
1. Open the Firecamp app and click the `WebSocket` option on the homepage.

2. Type the endpoint `ws://echo.websocket.org` in the URL bar if not there already and click the blue `Connect` button.

3. Type a message in the Message panel.

4. To save a message, click the `Send & Save` button next to the `Send` button. This would send the message to the server and save them in the `Message Collection` panel on the right for later use.

 - Optionally, you can save a group of messages together by mentioning a Title for them before saving in the `Title` box.

5. Hover over the list of messages saved in the `Message Collection` panel with the mouse. Click the downward arrow that appears next to the desired title to open messages grouped under that title.

6. Hover and click the `Send` button on the desired message that appears on the list.

 - Alternatively, if you like to delete a message then click the Bin icon that appears on hovering over messages.

Voila! You successfully learned to manage saved messages in Firecamp WebSocket app.
