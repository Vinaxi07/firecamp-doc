Monitoring events in realtime is what makes WebSockets extremely functional. The server can send event messages on particular event occurrence at server-side in real-time. Hence, in the next few steps, we will be communicating with the server, checking the response and saving messages for future use.

## Prerequisites
- Establishing your First WebSocket connection

We will be using the sample endpoint `ws://echo.websocket.org` to establish the WebSocket connection.

## Directions
1. Open the Firecamp app and click the `WebSocket` option on the homepage.

2. Type the endpoint `ws://echo.websocket.org` in the URL bar if not there already and click the blue `Connect` button.

   - The status on the Chatboard panel will be displayed as `ws connection established successfully` meaning the connection has been established and we can start communicating with the server.

3. Type a message in `Text` or `JSON` format by navigating to the desired tab in the Message panel in the WebSocket app.

4. Click the `Send` button to send the message to the server. If there are any event messages sent in real time by the server, these can be checked in the Chatboard panel.

   - This specific endpoint `ws://echo.websocket.org` reponds with the same message that the user has sent.

Voila! You successfully connected and communicated with the server. Up next, we will learn how to manage and send Saved Messages in the WebSocket app.
