## Prerequisites
1. Basics of the [Impression URL bar](/websocket/i/url-bar/).
2. Basics of the [Impression Connections](/websocket/i/connections/).

## Directions
There is always one default connection when you'll open a WS tab. Now to create and connect other virtual client connections click on the `Connections` tab and follow the below steps

---

1. click on the `new connection` button at the top-right side of the message-playground.
2. Enter a connection name in opened popup. for example `Alice`. and hit enter to add it. Select the checkbox to connect it immediately after creation. 
3. Follow step-2 to create additional connections as much as you want like `Alice`, `Bob`, `Rikki`.
4. You can select any connection from the connection list (top-left side of the message-playground). apply `Headers` and `Query Params` and save the request.

> You can always switch between connections, connect and disconnect them from connection-control (right-side of the URL bar)
