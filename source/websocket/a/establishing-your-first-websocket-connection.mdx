In the next few steps, we will establish our very first WebSocket Connection with the Firecamp WebSocket app through the sample endpoint.

## Prerequisites
N/A

## Directions
1. Open the Firecamp app. If not installed, read the installation instructions.

2. Click `WebSocket` button on the homepage to open the `WebSocket` app

3. In the interface that opens, type the endpoint that you want to test in the URL bar. Firecamp by default has the sample endpoint `ws://echo.websocket.org` listed in the URL bar.

 - Optionally, you can specify environment snippets through the dropdown menu and enter protocols needed in the config box located on the left of the `Connect` button.

4. When the endpoint has been configured, click the blue `Connect` button to establish the connection with the server.

5. The status `ws connection established successfully` will appear in the Chatboard panel meaning the server is ready for further communication.

6. Alternatively to close the connection, hover over to the top area of the chatboard and click the blue `Close` button that appears. The updated status will appear in the Chatboard panel.

 - In the dialog box that appears, mention the `Close Status` code. It must be `1000` or in-between `3000` to `4999`. Optionally, mention the `Reason` as well if you are testing it.
 - When done, click the `Close WS` button to close the connection. The connection will be closed listing the `Close Status` and `Reason` in the Chatboard panel.

Voila! You established your first WebSocket connection successfully and closed it with proper status code and reason. Up next, we will learn how to communicate with the server through messages.
