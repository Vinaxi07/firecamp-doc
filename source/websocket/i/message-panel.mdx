# Overview

Sending and receiving messages while debugging your WebSocket connection is the core part of the experience with the Firecamp WebSocket app.

Through the message panel located at the bottom, users can click the `send` button to send messages in various formats to the server and check the response in the chatboard panel. Messages can be sent in two formats, namely `Text` and `JSON`.

One can alternatively, use the `Send & Save` button to send messages and simultaneously save them to the `Message Collection` panel located on the right in the WebSocket app. Optionally, messages being sent can be grouped in the `Message Collection` panel for better management if the titles are same. This can be achieved by adding a title using the `Title` input bar located at the bottom.
